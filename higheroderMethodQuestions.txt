Explain the following questions in your own words

What is the difference between forEach, map, filter and reduce ?
 Explain these using your own words Explain the difference between function declaration and arrow function ? Explain the difference between find and findIndex ? If you like to filter out one object element in an array which method do you like to use: filter or find ? Explain Explain the difference of var, let and const when we declare a variable ?

a. What is the difference between forEach, map, filter and reduce ?
ans = 1. Foreach
Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on each element of array one by one.
var arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.forEach(function (elem, index){
   console.log(elem + ' comes at ' + index);
})

For every element on the array we are calling a callback.
Basically forEach works as a  for loop looping over the array.


2. Map
Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but it generate a new array based on your existing array.

map with an example
var arr = [1, 2, 3] // it's not gonna change

var mapped = arr.map(function(elem) {
    return elem * 10;
})

let mapped = arr.map(elem => elem * 10)
console.log(mapped);

output
[10, 20, 30]


3. Filter
Filter it provide a callback for every element and returns a filtered array.
The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.
var arr = [1, 2, 3] 

var result = arr.filter(function(elem){
    return elem !== 2;
})
console.log(result)

var result = arr.filter(elem => elem !== 2)
output 
[1, 3]

4. Reduce
reduce method of the array object is used to reduce the array to one single value.
For example if you have to add all the elements of an array you can do something like this.
var arr = [1, 2, 3] 

var sum = arr.reduce(function(sum, elem){
    return sum + elem;
})

or 

var sum = arr.reduce((sum, elem) => sum + elem)
console.log(sum)

b.Explain the difference between function declaration and arrow function ?

ans =
Function declarations

The Syntax
function soal(){
// your code inside this function
}

1. function declaration attach themselves to enclosing scope.
function soal(){
//your code
}
If you declare a function in the global scope using function declaration, The scope of the function is global. this is one of the key differences compared to function expressions
2. Function declarations are affected by hoisting.
sayHello()  // function calling
function sayHello(){
     console.log(“Hello”);
}
You can call a function before you declare it. because of hoisting.

Arrow Functions

The Syntax
()=>{}
